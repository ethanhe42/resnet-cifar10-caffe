```

### Training

```bash
#build caffe
git clone https://github.com/yihui-he/resnet-cifar10-caffe
./download_cifar.sh
./train.sh [GPUs] [NET]
#eg., ./train.sh 0 resnet-20
#find logs at resnet-20/logs
```

### Visualization

specify caffe path in [cfgs.py](cfgs.py) and use plot.py to generate beautful loss plots.

```bash
python plot.py PATH/TO/LOGS
```

Results are consistent with original paper. seems thereâ€™s no much difference between resnet-20 and plain-20. However, from the second plot, you can see that plain-110 have difficulty to converge.

### How I generate prototxts:

use [net_generator.py](net_generator.py) to generate `solver.prototxt` and `trainval.prototxt`, you can generate resnet or plain net of depth 20/32/44/56/110, or even deeper if you want. you just need to change `n` according to `depth=6n+2`

### How I generate lmdb data:

```bash
./create_cifar.sh
```

create 4 pixel padded training LMDB and testing LMDB, then create a soft link `ln -s cifar-10-batches-py` in this folder. - get [cifar10 python version](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) - use [data_utils.py](data_utils.py) to generate 4 pixel padded training data and testing data. Horizontal flip and random crop are performed on the fly while training.
